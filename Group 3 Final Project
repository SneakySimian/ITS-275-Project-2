/** The goal of our project is to develop a program that determines the price for shipping.
 *  More specifically determining the time it takes to mail something from one location to another, 
 *  calculating shipping price based on shipping time. There will also be an added price for different-sized boxes. 
 *  (Bigger =more money)
